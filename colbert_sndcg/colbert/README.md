The code in this folder is taken from the repository "https://github.com/cmacdonald/ColBERT/tree/v0.2/".
We make adjustments (mainly to modeling/colbert.py) to support the modified versions of ColBERT we want to
evaluate (i.e. different linear layers and subword aggregation (and corresponding replication) strategies).

We also add some functions to help our evaluation.
