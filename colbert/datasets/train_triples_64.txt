causes of complex visual hallucinations	Tumors that lie along, or compress, the optic path may cause visual hallucinations. In one case series, 13 of 59 patients with temporal lobe tumors experienced visual hallucinations. These hallucinations are described as complex and may involve vivid scenes (including people carrying out mundane tasks).	The theater also features a complex video system with 28 projectors and two 20-foot-high by 100-foot-wide screens, which contribute to the visual experience. LOVE is not a typical Cirque du Soleil show with high-flying trapeze artists, gymnasts and acrobats.
an electron group is defined as	Electron Groups. In determining the geometry of molecules, the valence shell electron pair repulsion model, or VSEPR, assumes that repulsions between electron pairs causes them to remain as far apart as possible. The geometry that the molecule ultimately adopts minimizes the repulsion between electron pairs.n determining the geometry of molecules, the valence shell electron pair repulsion model, or VSEPR, assumes that repulsions between electron pairs causes them to remain as far apart as possible. The geometry that the molecule ultimately adopts minimizes the repulsion between electron pairs.	Electron carriers are reduced during glycolysis and the citric acid cycle to NADH + H+ and FADH2. These carriers then donate electrons and protons to the electron carrier proteins of the electron transport chain. The final electron acceptor is oxygen.Together with oxygen, electrons and protons form molecules of water.our protein complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane form the electron transport chain. These complexes exist in a descending order of energy. Here the electron carriers come along to drop off all their electron and proton cargo that they picked up during the glycolysis and citric acid cycle stages.
who developed the esi triage system	Severity Index (ESI) The Emergency Severity Index (ESI) is a five-level triage scale developed by ED physicians Richard Wuerz and David Eitel in the United States (Gilboy et al., 1999; Wuerz, Milne, Eitel, Travers & Gilboy, 2000). The two originators believed that a principal role for an emergency department triage instrument	Mathematics in China emerged independently by the 11th century BC. The Chinese independently developed very large and negative numbers, decimals, a place value decimal system, a binary system, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry.
what causes dark spots around the stem of tomatoes	Fungal Leaf & Fruit Spots of Tomato I. There are many fungi that cause leaf and fruit spots on tomatoes. The ones described here are similar in that they do not have obvious fungal growth on either the leaf or the fruit spots.	If your tomatoes look black on the bottoms, they're probably suffering from blossom end rot. Blossom end rot can be identified by a black or dark discoloration, usually with a water-soaked appearance. It can also appear on peppers and eggplant.

This is the number reached when new seats were added in 1913, and the number was locked b â¦ y the Reapportionment Act of 1929. From 1959 to 1963, there were temporarily 437 seats. There are 6 other non-voting delegates.
what cancer is symbolized by a green ribbon?	Green Ribbon : Meaning: This color is a symbol of childhood depression, missing children, open records for adoptees, environmental concerns, kidney cancer, tissue/organ donation, homeopathy, and worker and driving safety.	Endoplasmic reticulum is often abbreviated as ER; hence, smooth type is denoted as SER and the rough type is symbolized as RER. There are interesting differences in structures and functions between these two types and, this article summarizes most of those.

what are chemical symbols used for	A chemical symbol is an abbreviation or shortened version of the name of a chemical element, generally assigned in relation to its Latin name. Natural elements all have symbols of one or two letters; some man-made elements have temporary symbols of three letters.	In this lesson you will learn: about chemical equations, the equation symbols used to write chemical equations and how to write chemical equations properly. For this lesson, you will need your periodic table and your polyatomic ion cheat sheet.
what is algebra really about	Algebra is one of the broad parts of mathematics, together with number theory, geometry and analysis. In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols; it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics. As such, it includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups, rings, and fields. The more basic parts of algebra are called elementary algebra; the more abstract parts are called	Mathematics in China emerged independently by the 11th century BC. The Chinese independently developed very large and negative numbers, decimals, a place value decimal system, a binary system, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry.

where does eggplant grow	By Kathee Mierzejewski. Eggplant (Solanum melongena) is one of the vegetables you can grow in your garden but is very sensitive to cold. When deciding to grow eggplants, remember that they are similar to peppers and tomatoes.In fact, theyâre in the same family. They should be planted after the chance of any sort of frost.ow to Plant Eggplant. When growing eggplant, you want to remember that planting eggplant from seed should be done indoors or in a greenhouse setting. This protects the new little seedlings from any sort of frost. When planting eggplant, if you plant them too early, you will risk hurting the plant.	If your tomatoes look black on the bottoms, they're probably suffering from blossom end rot. Blossom end rot can be identified by a black or dark discoloration, usually with a water-soaked appearance. It can also appear on peppers and eggplant.
what information does a chemical equation contain	A chemical equation is used in the means of writing out and describing a chemical reaction, such as the reactants and the substance that forms after the reaction (called the p â¦ roduct)   P.S: it took me a little to find out the question since i had it too.he reactions in which heat is given out are called exothermic reactions. This information is provided by adding a heat term only the product-side (right hand side) of the chemical equation. For example, (a) When carbon is burnt in air (or oxygen) heat is evolved.	In this lesson you will learn: about chemical equations, the equation symbols used to write chemical equations and how to write chemical equations properly. For this lesson, you will need your periodic table and your polyatomic ion cheat sheet.
